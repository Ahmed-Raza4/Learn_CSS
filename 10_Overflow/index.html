        When working with web layouts, managing content that 
        exceeds the boundaries of its container is essential. 
        The overflow property in CSS is a powerful tool for 
        this purpose. It controls what happens to content that 
        is too large to fit within a given area. By using 
        values such as visible, hidden, scroll, and auto, 
        developers can decide whether to clip the overflowing
        content, provide scrollbars, or simply allow it to
        spill out of its container. Understanding how to 
        effectively use overflow is crucial for creating 
        responsive and user-friendly designs, especially 
        when dealing with dynamic content or complex layouts
